# Hazard Avoidance Program for all devices (TensorFlow.js)
This is a program that can avoid hazards caused by obstacles such as people, cars, and so on. It can save you from collisions or falls.

This code is based on my "tfjs-hazard-avoidance," but the main source of this code is "Make a smart webcam in JavaScript with a TensorFlow.js pre-trained Machine Learning model."<br>
